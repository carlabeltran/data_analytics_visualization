# 4.1 Introduction to Pandas

* For those without the PythonData environment: 

```bash
conda create -n PythonData python=3.6 anaconda
```

* Do not run inside virtual environment (i.e., PythonData)
```bash
conda install -c anaconda nb_conda_kernels
```

* Pandas
* Data Frame
* Jupyter Notebook

```bash
source activate PythonData
```

* To run jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

* The location where you open the jupyter notebook is really important.
* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42063716/pandas-sum-up-multiple-columns-into-one-column-without-last-column>

* We talked in class about writing commit messages for git, and using git commit -m "<write your commit message here>" to avoid opening an editor to write your message.  In case you didn't set your editor to VSCode, Atom, Notepad, or something else during the git installation, you may end up in Vim, which is not where you want to be.

  * To quit Vim, type: ESC then :q! then ENTER
  * Fix the problem with this command: git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

* When copying/pasting from a terminal be very careful: most terminals use Ctrl-c to end a process that is running, rather than to copy.  For Git Bash, you can use Ctrl-insert to copy and Shift-insert to paste.

## 03-Ins_IntroToPandas

```bash
# Dependencies
import pandas as pd

# We can create a Pandas Series from a raw list
data_series = pd.Series(["UCLA", "UC Berkeley", "UC Irvine",
                         "University of Central Florida", "Rutgers University"])
data_series
```

```bash
# Convert a list of dictionarys into a dataframe
states_dicts = [{"STATE": "New Jersey", "ABBREVIATION": "NJ"},
                {"STATE": "New York", "ABBREVIATION": "NY"}]

df_states = pd.DataFrame(states_dicts)
df_states
```

```bash
# Convert a single dictionary containing lists into a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"Dynasty": ["Early Dynastic Period", "Old Kingdom"],
     "Pharoh": ["Thinis", "Memphis"]
     }
)
df
```


## 04-Stu_DataFrameShop

```bash
# Import Dependencies
import pandas as pd

# DataFrame should have 3 columns: Frame, Price, and Sales AND 5 rows of data
# Convert a single dictionary containing lists into a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"Frame": ["Ornate", "Classical", "Modern", "Wood", "Cardbard"],
     "Price": [15.0, 12.5, 10.0, 5.0, 1.0],
     "Sales": [100, 200, 150, 300, "N/A"]
     }
)
df
```

```bash
# Use a different method of creating DataFrames to
# Create a DataFrame for an art gallery that contains three columns - "Painting", "Price", and "Popularity"
# and has 4 rows of data
# Convert a list of dictionarys into a dataframe
art_dicts = [{"Painting": "Mona Lisa (Knockoff)", "Popularity": "Very Popular", "Price": 25},
             {"Painting": "Van Gogh (Knockoff)", "Popularity": "Popular", "Price": 20},
             {"Painting": "Starving Artist", "Popularity": "Average", "Price": 10},
             {"Painting": "Toddler Drawing", "Popularity": "Not Popular", "Price": 1}]

df_art = pd.DataFrame(art_dicts)
df_art
```


## 05-Ins_DataFunctions

```bash

# Dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Save path to data set in a variable
data_file = "Resources/dataSet.csv"

# Use Pandas to read data
data_file_pd = pd.read_csv(data_file)
data_file_pd.head()
```

```bash
# Display a statistical overview of the DataFrame
data_file_pd.describe()
```

```bash
# Reference a single column within a DataFrame
data_file_pd["Amount"].head()
```

```bash
# Reference multiple columns within a DataFrame
data_file_pd[["Amount", "Gender"]].head()
```

```bash
# The mean method averages the series
average = data_file_pd["Amount"].mean()
average
```

```bash
# The sum method adds every entry in the series
total = data_file_pd["Amount"].sum()
total
```

```bash
# The unique method shows every element of the series that appears only once
unique = data_file_pd["Last Name"].unique()
unique
```

```bash
# The value_counts method counts unique values in a column
count = data_file_pd["Gender"].value_counts()
count
```

```bash
# Calculations can also be performed on Series and added into DataFrames as new columns
thousands_of_dollars = data_file_pd["Amount"]/1000
data_file_pd["Thousands of Dollars"] = thousands_of_dollars

data_file_pd.head()
```

## 06-Stu_TrainingGrounds

```bash
# Collecting a summary of all numeric data
training_data.describe()

# Finding the names of the trainers
training_data["Trainer"].unique()

# Finding how many students each trainer has
training_data["Trainer"].value_counts()

# Finding the average weight of all students
training_data["Weight"].mean()

# Finding the combined weight of all students
training_data["Weight"].sum()

# Converting the membership days into weeks and then adding a column to the DataFrame
membership_weeks = training_data["Membership(Days)"] / 7
training_data["Membership(Weeks)"] = membership_weeks

training_data.head()
```

## 07-Ins_ColumnManipulation

```bash
# Collecting a list of all columns within the DataFrame
training_data.columns

# Reorganizing the columns using double brackets
organized_df = training_data[["Trainer", "Name","Weight","Membership(Days)"]]
organized_df.head()

# Using .rename(columns={}) in order to rename columns
renamed_df = organized_df.rename(columns={"Membership(Days)":"Membership in Days", "Weight":"Weight in Pounds"})
renamed_df.head()
```

## 08-Stu_Hey_Arnold

```bash
# import dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Create a data frame with given columns and value
hey_arnold = pd.DataFrame(
    {"Character_in_show": ["Arnold", "Gerald", "Helga", "Phoebe", "Harold", "Eugene"],
     "color_of_hair": ["blonde", "black", "blonde", "black", "unknown", "red"],
     "Height": ["average", "tallish", "tallish", "short", "tall", "short"],
     "Football_Shaped_Head": [True, False, False, False, False, False]
     })

hey_arnold

# Rename columns to clean up the look
renamed_hey_arnold = hey_arnold.rename(columns={ "Character_in_show": "Character", "color_of_hair": "Hair Color", "Football_Shaped_Head": "Football Head"})

renamed_hey_arnold

# Organize columns into a more logical order
# `Character`, `Football Head`, `Hair Color`, `Height`

ordered_hey_arnold = renamed_hey_arnold[["Character", "Football Head", "Hair Color", "Height"]]

ordered_hey_arnold

```

## 09-Ins_ReadingWritingCSV

```bash
# Dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Store filepath in a variable
file_one = "Resources/DataOne.csv"

# Read our Data file with the pandas library
# Not every CSV requires an encoding, but be aware this can come up
file_one_df = pd.read_csv(file_one, encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# Show just the header
file_one_df.head()

# Show a single column
file_one_df["first_name"].head()

# Show mulitple specific columns--note the extra brackets
file_one_df[["first_name", "email"]].head()

# Head does not change the DataFrame--it only displays it
file_one_df.head()

# Export file as a CSV, without the Pandas index, but with the header
file_one_df.to_csv("Output/fileOne.csv", index=False, header=True)
```

## 10-Stu_GoodReads

```bash
# Import Dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Make a reference to the books.csv file path

books_csv_file = "Resources/books.csv"

# Import the books.csv file as a DataFrame
books_df = pd.read_csv(books_csv_file, encoding="utf-8")

books_df.head()

# Rename the headers to be more explanatory
# Rename the columns to the following: `ISBN`, `Publication Year`, `Original Title`, `Authors`,
# `One Star Reviews`, `Two Star Reviews`, `Three Star Reviews`, `Four Star Reviews`, and `Five Star Reviews`
books_df_renamed = books_df_reduced.rename(columns={ "isbn": "ISBN", "original_publication_year": "Original Publication Year", "original_title": "Original Title", "authors": "Authors", "ratings_1": "One Star Reviews", "ratings_2": "Two Star Reviews", "ratings_3":"Three Star Reviews", "ratings_4": "Four Star Reviews", "ratings_5": "Five Star Reviews"})

books_df_renamed.head()

# Push the remade DataFrame to a new CSV file

# Read the modified GoodReads csv and store into Pandas DataFrame
books_df = pd.read_csv(file_to_load, encoding="utf-8")

books_df.head()

# Calculate the number of unique authors in the DataFrame
num_authors = books_df["Authors"].nunique()
