* Regression
  * 1.) Perform the regression
    * y = mx + b
  * 2.) Analyze the regression
  * Whole point of regressions is making predictions.
  * Select Residuals in Excel.
    * The distance between each dot and the regression line (measured vertically).
  * Multipe R is correlation.
    * Correlation does not mean causation.
    * Correlation runs from -1 to 1.
  * R^2 = coefficient of definition.
    * How close is the line to the dots.
    * If line is close to the dots, you have a high R^2.
    * If line is far from the dots, you have a low R^2.
    * R^2 goes from 0 to 1.
    * Higher R^2 are better.
  * P-value
    * Very small p-value means we trust the results (means the results are significant.)
  * x-axis  is independent axis.
  * y-axis is dependent axis.
  * does number of points (y-axis) affect minutes played (x-axis)?
